## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts: the backend and the UI.

## Backend

The backend of the project is implemented using the MVC pattern, Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. The data is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The backend provides a set of RESTful APIs to interact with the data.

To get started with the backend:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
cd back-end/

2. Install the dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the server:
npm start


The backend will be up and running on the specified port(8080), providing the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with the database.

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is implemented using React.js, TypeScript, and Material-UI. It utilizes Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions and managing application state. Styled Components is used for styling the components, providing a flexible and maintainable approach to styling in React applications. Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend APIs.

To get started with the frontend:

1. Navigate to the ui directory:
cd ui/

2. Install the dependencies:
npm install


3. Start the development server:
npm start

4. Access the Travel Blog in your web browser:
Open your preferred web browser.
